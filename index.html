                    December 1998 Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know . To help you see how much your contribution means , I 'm sharing with you The words of people who have lived Goodwill 's mission . We want you to Know why your support of Goodwill is so important . Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that comes with work . `` I was sad when I could n't go to the snack bar to buy a soda . Now I can buy a soda and spend money . I like working and making money . I have a savings account . I can write my name on the deposit slip . If I was n't working here ... I would be sad ... '' -- Maureen Because turning welfare recipients into tax payers just makes sense . `` When I first came to Goodwill I was a single parent with little or no self-esteem . I was on welfare and without my diploma . Coming to Goodwill was the first step toward my becoming totally independent . I am now ... totally off of welfare . I really like my job . '' -- Sherry Because people want to work . `` I 'd never finished high school . I had no experience or skills ... The only thing I did know for sure was here 's a chance to change things for me and my children ... I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow . I wanted to be there ... I had my second chance to change my life . '' -- Donna Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire life . `` Before I got to Goodwill , I was on a mission . I just wanted a job . It did n't matter what the job was , I just wanted one . Now , I 'm on a journey . I 've got more than a job ; I 've got a career . My instructor played a role like no other instructor I 've ever had I appreciate everything that Goodwill has done for me . '' -- Cornell Each year , we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles . Their one common goal : they all want to work . A robust economy helps by providing job opportunities , but to be honest , most of the people who are n't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest obstacles . The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like health care , transportation and child care - problems that are big enough on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental disabilities , illiteracy and lack of job skills . Last year , Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their self-sufficiency . Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support services that will help even more find jobs . Right now , there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels like to support themselves . You can help them to know that feeling . Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs . Use the enclosed card and give a generous gift to Goodwill today ! Sincerely , James M. McClelland President
